    <h2>Module 6 : Basic Algorithm Scripting</h2>
    <ul>
        An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.
        To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts, and think 
        carefully about how to solve each part with code.
        <br>
        In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms that 
        do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.
