/*
Sometimes you will need to build a string, using variables. 
By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables 
into a string you're building.

Example:

Example:

var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
ourStr would have a value of the string 
Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.

*/

/* 
Task: Set myName to a string equal to your name and 
build myStr with myName between the strings My name is and and I am well!

*/

var myName = "Soban Khan"
var myStr = "My Name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
console.log(myStr);
