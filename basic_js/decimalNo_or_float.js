/*
We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as 
floating point numbers or floats.

Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors
*/

//Task: Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7).
var myDecimal = 5.7;
console.log(myDecimal);
