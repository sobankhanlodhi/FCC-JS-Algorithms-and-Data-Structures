//In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.
// MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar.

/*
Best Practice is to write variable name and function in camelCase
In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase 
and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

for example:
*/
var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var sobanKhanLodhi;


/*Task: Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.
Given
// Variable declarations
var StUdLyCapVaR;
var properCamelCase;
var TitleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
STUDLYCAPVAR = 10;
PRoperCAmelCAse = "A String";
tITLEcASEoVER = 9000;

Test Case: studlyCapVar should be defined and have a value of 10.

Test Case: properCamelCase should be defined and have a value of the string A String.

Test Case: titleCaseOver should be defined and have a value of 9000.

Test Case: studlyCapVar should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.

Test Case: properCamelCase should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.

Test Case: titleCaseOver should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.
