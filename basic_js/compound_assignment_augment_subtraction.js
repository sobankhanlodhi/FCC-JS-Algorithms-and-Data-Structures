/* 
                Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction -=

In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable
Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

myVar = myVar - 5;
will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:
myVar -= 5;

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.
