/*
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator.
You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings,
so you'll need to add them yourself.

Another Example:

var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
console.log(ourStr);

The string 
I come first. I come second. would be displayed in the console.

*/

/* 
Task: Build myStr from the strings This is the start. and This is the end. using the + operator.
*/
var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";

console.log(myStr);
