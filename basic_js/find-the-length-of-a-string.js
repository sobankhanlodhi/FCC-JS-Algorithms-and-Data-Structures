/*
You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.
For example, if we created a variable var firstName = "Charles", 
we could find out how long the string Charles is by using the firstName.length property.

Example:
console.log("Alan Peter".length);
The value 10 would be displayed in the console.

*/

/*Task:  
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";
lastNameLength = lastName;

Use the .length property to count the number of characters in the lastName variable 
and assign it to lastNameLength.
*/

var lastNameLength =0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";
lastNameLength = lastName.length;
console.log(lastNameLength);
