/* 
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.
We can also subtract one number from another.
JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

//Example:
myVar = 12 - 6;     //myVar now has the value 6.

/* Task: 
var difference = 45 - 0;
Change the 0 so the difference is 12.

The variable difference should be equal to 12.
You should only subtract one number from 45.
