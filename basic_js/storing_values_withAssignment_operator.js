// In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=). e.g:

//First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar.
var myVar;
myVar = 5;

// If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before 
// the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.


//Task: Assign the value 7 to variable a.
var a;
a=7;

console.log(a);
