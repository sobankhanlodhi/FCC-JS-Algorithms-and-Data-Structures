/*
            Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.

/* Task:
var lastName = "Lovelace";

var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line

Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the 
lastName variable using bracket notation.
*/

var lastName = "Lovelace";
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];

console.log(thirdLetterOfLastName);
