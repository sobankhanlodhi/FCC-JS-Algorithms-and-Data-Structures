    <h2>Module 2 : ES6 or ECMAScript 2015</h2>
    <ul>
        ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.
        Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is always evolving, and new features are released every year.
        ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language.
        <br>
        In this course, you'll learn these new features, including let and const, arrow functions, classes, promises, and modules.
