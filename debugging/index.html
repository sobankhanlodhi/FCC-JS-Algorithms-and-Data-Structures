    <h2>Module 4 : Debugging</h2>
    <ul>
        Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them. Issues in code 
        generally come in three forms: syntax errors that prevent your program from running, 
        runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior, or 
        logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended.
        <br>
        In this course, you'll learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common 
        issues before they happen.
