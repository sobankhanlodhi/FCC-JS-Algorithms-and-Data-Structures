    <h2>Module 8 : Functional Programming</h2>
    <ul>
        Functional Programming is another popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, 
        code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.
        <br>
        In this course, you'll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming including pure functions, 
        how to avoid mutations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like .map() and .filter().
